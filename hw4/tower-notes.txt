Speedup
The speedup predicate on the following test case showed that my tower was
8.2727272727272716x faster than my plain_tower.
[plain_]tower(4, _, counts([2,2,1,3],[1,3,3,2],[2,2,3,1],[2,3,1,2]))


Ambiguous
The call `?- ambiguous(N, C, T1, T2).` returned many ambiguous cases start at
N=4. This was the first output.

C = counts([4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4],[4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4])
N = 4
T1 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,1,4,3],[3,4,1,2],[4,3,2,1]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,4,1,3],[3,1,4,2],[4,3,2,1]]
